2019-01-24  Version 007

	Main script:

	* KDE plot: Use data only included in the range of graph.  Exclude data out of the range.

	Configuration file:

	* kde_multiplier: obsolete. Now automatically calculated.

	* opt_hist_density is a new option.  Histogram is shown by density of sample instead of number of sample
	
	
2018-09-12  Version 006

	Main script:

	* python3 is now default

	* calc_age_7Pb_6Pb: Calculate and output 7Pb/6Pb ages with errors

	* ConcAgeConv: Corrected equations for MSWDs and P-values

	* discordance: Added the fourth method of discordance

	Configuration file: new variables

	* accept_data_points is a new option

2017-10-30  Version 005

	Main script:

	* kde_multiplier: Corrected for a proper use of kde_multiplier

	* plotConcConv, plotConcTW: Specify markeredgecolor

	* plot_diagramse: Now ploting diagrams can be selected.

	Configuration file: new variables

	* plot_diagrams: Choose diagrams to be plotted


2017-04-17  Version 004

	Main script:

	* calc_age_7Pb_6Pb: 207Pb/206Pb ages with errors can be calculated

	* ConcAgeConv, ConcAgeTW: Output probability of concordia ages as
	P(chi^2) with MSWDs

	* myEllipse: Show a warning message, if error ellipses could not
	be drawn.  This may be mainly caused by inappropriate correlation
	coefficient between X and Y (rho_xy or rho_XY).


	Configuration file: new variables

	* digits_number_output: Set number of decimal digits (significant
	figures)

	* ca_mswd: Select one of MSWDs for concordia ages, which include
	concordance (0), equivalence (1), and combined of them (2).


2016-11-15  Version 003

	Main script:

	* Outputs have now two significant figures

	* Remove assumption of Th/U errors (10%), if they are not given.

	* Use equation (2a) in York (2004, Am. J. Phys., vol. 72,
	p. 367-375) for uncertainties of regression lines to simplify the
	equation


2016-09-26  Version 002

	Main script:

	* Add comments for Python3 users

	* Modify algorithm of calculations of regression lines

	* Correct equation for correlation coefficient (rho_xy) in
	Tera-Wasserburg diagram

	* plot_2D_wm: name of function was renamed from plot_2D_wma


	Configuration file:

	* opt_2D_wm: name of variable was rename from opt_2D_wma

	* oneD_band_alpha: a new variable to determine transparency of
	confidence regions of regression lines


2016-08-05  Version 001

	* Initial release
